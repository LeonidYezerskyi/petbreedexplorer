Pet Breed Explorer

Objective

This project is designed to build a web application that lets users explore various breeds of cats and dogs in a fun and informative way. The main focus is on providing a simple, easy-to-use interface where users can browse through random breeds, view detailed information about each breed, and see a gallery of images for each breed.

Features

Homepage
The homepage presents a collection of random cat and dog breeds. Each breed is displayed as a card featuring an image and the breed's name. This provides users with a quick glance at the different breeds available. Clicking on any breed card directs the user to a dedicated breed page with more in-depth details.

Breed Page
The breed page offers comprehensive details about the selected breed. Users can explore specific information about the breed, including its characteristics, and view a gallery of images showcasing different animals of that breed. This page is dynamically generated based on the breed selected from the homepage.
